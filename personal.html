<h1>WELCOME To PIA'S DIARY</h1>
<p>
    My full name is Pia Galang Mabutin born in Bagong Bantay, Quezon City on the 30th day of July 2003. When I was a little child my first dream was to become a nurse, but it changes when I turned 14 i decided I'd rather become a pharmacist beacuse I was fascinated about chemicals and such. But I also think that what if I upgrade it that is when I decided to like Chemical Engineering. When I was a Senior High School I took Academic Track, STEM strand, and there I was become aware about chemicals and I tried my very best to study the Chemistry subject.
But then my family decided to migrate here in Manila to continue my education in college. I tried enrolling for public schools to pursue my dream, I went to UP Diliman, Polytechnic of the Philippines, and many more. Unfortunately I hadn't accepted to any school that I applied but lucky enough to be offered by scholarship brought by the Parish that led me to study at the school of Colegio de Sta. Teresa de Avila. This school teaches me a lot of things the teachers here are very competent especially at the Department of Information Technology thta hones my 
skills and talents. </p>
